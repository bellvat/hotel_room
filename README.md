# hotel_room
This is practice for understanding basic oop design.
A hotel is initiated with 2 rooms, one cheap, one expensive.
When hotel.rb is executed, it asks the user what time of room he/she would like to book, and the date.
If on that date the hotel is not booked, it will display 'success', otherwise 'not available'.

Currently it is set to ask the user 3 times, and dates are strings.

In irb, the file can be opened with require './hotel.rb'.
